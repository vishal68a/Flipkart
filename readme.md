# Flipkart Clone

This project is a clone of the popular e-commerce website, Flipkart. It allows users to browse products, add items to the cart, and explore various deals and offers. However, the project is currently limited in functionality as the login page is not working and the database is not connected, which means users cannot purchase items.

## Features

- **Product Browsing**: Users can explore a wide range of products across different categories.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add items to their cart for future reference or potential purchase.
- **Deals and Offers**: Displays various deals and offers similar to the original Flipkart site.

## Limitations

- **Login Page**: The login functionality is not operational as the database connection is not established.
- **Purchases**: Users can add items to the cart but cannot complete the purchase process.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB**
- **Express.js**
- **React**
- **Node.js** (MERN Stack)
